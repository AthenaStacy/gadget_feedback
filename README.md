# gadget_feedback

This is the set of Gadget2 routines (https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/) used for evolving smoothed particle hydrodynamics particles under the effects of gravity and thermodynamics.  We have also added code to model the radiative feedback effects of stars which form within the gas as it is evolved in the Gadget2 simulation box.
